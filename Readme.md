# Anomaly Detection Models Using Keystroke Dynamics (Behavioral Biometrics)

How does a system identify users based on their typing rhythms? Keystroke dynamics is the analysis of typing rhythms to discriminate among users and it has been proposed for detecting impostors (i.e. both insiders and external attackers). Typing biometrics is part of a larger class of biometrics known as "behavioral biometrics" which uses different individual's typing pattern to authenticate individual person's identity.

The case study includes using a dataset which consists of typing speed information of a passcode by group of 51 different users recorded at different time intervals, building a classifier that recognizes typing pattern of different users, test the classifier on 5 different datasets having typing speed information of 5 different users and identify the right user.
